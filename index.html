			<span class="subheading">How It Works</span>
			<p>
				By generating your private/public asymmetric key pair, data encrypted is secure. The data is encrypted using the public key, but can only be decrypted using the private key. The public key is shared with your followers. The private key remains on your computer.<br/>
				To further protect the data, during transit all data is encrypted a second time (encrypt the encrypted data) using a master private/public asymmetric key pair. The master private key is stored securely in the cloud and used only by the Oak and Lion transfer functions.
				Oak and Lion never collects your IP address, email address, or any other personally identifiable information. Only the identity name you choose could <strong>POSSIBLY</strong> be used to identify you.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<span class="subheading">Credit Card Information</span>
				Because there is cost to Oak and Lion to enable the secure transfer of data through the cloud, there is a limit to the amount identities you can have and the amount of transactions for an identity. In order to pay for more identities and transactions, you will have to enter a valid credit card.<br/>
				Only the credit card number, expiration date, and CVC are collected. All of this is stored using <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, a reputable and secure credit card processing service. This information could also be linked to you as personally identifiable information. Your name and address are never collected. The information is
				stored with <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, not with Oak and Lion. <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> uses a token system to link Oak and Lion to the credit card in <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>.
			<br/>
			<br/>
				<span class="subheading">Terms of Service</span>
				Oak and Lion will provide secure transfer of information between consenting and knowing parties <strong>OVER THE AGE OF 18</strong>. Legal minors are prohibited from using this service in any way. You agree to not send information to parties that are not expecting it. You also agree to not receive information from parties that are unknown to you.
				<br/>
				This service is provided only for <strong>LEGAL TRANSFER OF INFORMATION</strong>. You agree to not send or receive illegal information, including, but not limited to, illegal drugs, illegal pornography, terrorism, stolen information, such as identity theft, or any other information prohibited by applicable laws.
				<br/>
				Oak and Lion will <strong>ONLY COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN PRESENTED WITH A WARRANT</strong>. Your privacy is subjected to applicable laws, both domestic and international. However, in the situation of a warrant or other knowledge of illegal activity, Oak and Lion will comply with law enforcement to protect those who are in danger of 
				harm from the illegal transfer of information.
				<br/>
				Violation of these terms will result in the best effort of Oak and Lion to cooperate with law enforcement, when applicable. Further, identities targeted by law enforcement will be suspended.
			<br/><br/>
				<span class="subheading">Privacy Policy</span>
				Oak and Lion will never collect personally identifiable information. Your identity name with Oak and Lion could be used to identify you. Credit card information (see above) is stored on <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. This could also identify you.
				Oak and Lion will never give or sell any information to third parties. Oak and Lion will only cooperate with law enforcement when presented with a warrant that is subject to applicable laws, both domestic and international. Even in the event of law enforcement cooperation, Oak and Lion will only have the identity name, encrypted files, and <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> token to present to law enforcement. Files can only be decrypted using the private key <strong>THAT IS IN YOUR POSSESSION</strong>.
				Keep this key safe! Like all keys, physical and digital, it is only as safe as your handling of it. (Probably the NSA can decrypt the files without the private key, but that's a whole other set of concerns.)
